# Broguelike

A small roguelike game I'm using to teach myself Rust.
I really wanted to learn Bevy 0.10.x, but I've decided to stick with bracket-lib for the moment.


I'm following the [Rust Roguelike Tutorial](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/) 
by Herbert Wolverson, though I am making some structure changes and using
a tileset by [Kenney.nl](http://twitter.com/KenneyNL).

I also recommend Maciej Główka's [Roguelike tutorial](https://maciejglowka.com/blog/bevy-roguelike-tutorial-devlog-part-1/)
which has some really great concepts. The bevy version of my work was definitely leaning heavily into them. 
It's my intent to structure some of the part of this game similarly, eventually.

Mad props to Sarkahn for their [Bevy Roguelike](https://github.com/sarkahn/bevy_roguelike/)
which has provided a bevy (ha!) of inspiration, as well.
